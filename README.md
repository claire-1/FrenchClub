Berkeley High School French Club Website

At Berkeley High School, I built a website for the French Club, of which I was the President. 
The website has embedded audio, photos, written content, and a calendar and is responsive. 
I taught myself search engine optimization, installed a Google search code, and improved Google search results for the website.
It has four pages.
